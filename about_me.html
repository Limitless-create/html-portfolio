    My name is Saptarshi, but most people know me as Ani. I’m a passionate Python and full-stack web developer, deeply fascinated by the logic that drives technology. Currently, I’m exploring the depths of SQL and databases, always eager to learn something new. Problem-solving is not just a skill for me—it’s a source of joy. Alongside my technical side, I have a soul rooted in literature. I often write poetry, especially about love, longing, and separation. Writing gives my emotions a voice, and I find solace in the rhythm of words. Bengali is the language of my heart, while English helps me connect with the wider world. I'm a quiet, thoughtful person who values deep conversations over casual talk. I believe in simplicity, both in code and in life. I’m also in love—with a girl as cute as a panda—who unknowingly becomes the muse behind many of my verses. Aesthetics matter to me, whether in design, expression, or emotion. I'm endlessly curious and always striving to grow. Challenges inspire me rather than discourage me. Loyalty and kindness are values I live by. I often find myself writing late at night, under the calm presence of stars. Music soothes me, and silence speaks to me. I don’t mind being alone; I often find clarity in solitude. I believe everyone carries a story worth hearing, and I’m still writing mine—one thoughtful moment, one line of code, one verse at a time. Through everything, I remain true to who I am: Ani.
